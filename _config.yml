about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am a Ph.D. Student in Atmospheric Science and have been part of the UBC Weather Forecast Research (WFR) Team since May of 2019. Originally from Colorado, I obtained a BA in Physical Geography and a BS in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences from the University of Colorado, Boulder. During that time, I also received a certificate in weather forecasting from Penn State University. My research focus is on coupled atmosphere-wildland fire behavior modeling, forest fuel moisture forecasts, wildfire smoke forecasting, and field observations of controlled burns. I am currently developing low-cost, in situ instruments to observe/profile the vertical concentration of PM2.5 in wildfire smoke plumes. I am also working on a Numerical Weather Prediction derived Fire Weather Forecast Model to assess the moisture content within varied layers of the forest fuels (vegetation). My outside interests include snowboarding, climbing, backpacking, and biking.
