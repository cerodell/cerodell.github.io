  I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Atmospheric Science Department at the University of British Colombia Vancouver with a projected graduation date of August 2024.

  My research interests include; coupled atmosphere-wildland fire behavior modeling, fire weather forecasting, forest fuel moisture predictions, wildfire smoke forecasting, and creating innovative ways to reduce the costs of collecting fire profile data during controlled burn experiments.

  My Ph.D. thesis is focused on developing an <a target="_blank" href="https://cerodell.github.io/fwf-docs/build/html/index.html">hourly fire danger rating system</a> (FDRS) using numerical weather predictions. The innovative approach offers forecast shifts in peak fire danger timing, especially during intensified fire activity in the late evening and early morning hours. It also allows for multiple periods of increased fire danger per day—a contrast to the conventional FDRS. For this research, I work closely with wildfire management agencies in Canada to help improve the daily operational fire danger assessments and predictions.

  I am also a Co-creator and Instructor (with Dr. Rolland Stull - my Ph.D. Supervisor and Department Chair) of a new fourth-year Synoptic Fire Weather Forecasting Course. The course rolled out in September 2023 addresses a wide variety of meteorological and fire forecasting topics.

  My outside interests include snowboarding, climbing, backpacking, surfing, and biking.

          - Developing a Numerical Weather Prediction derived Fire Weather Forecast Model to assess the moisture content within varied layers of the forest fuels (vegetation) for daily use by operational wildland firefighters.
            - This hourly forest fuel moisture forecast is being integrated into a fire growth and fuel emissions model to aid in smoke forecast predictions in the Bluesky Canada smoke forecast system.
            - A webpage was created for displaying the Fire Weather Forecast products, associated meteorology, and current wildfire locations on a zoomable map with popup point forecast functionality. For more information, visit the Fire Weather Forecast website.
          - Constructed low-cost, in situ instruments to observe and profile the vertical concentration of PM2.5 in wildfire smoke plumes. These disposable Particulate Matter Sensors, calibrated against an industry-standard GRIMM OPC, provide a low-cost way to collect data to better understand wildfire smoke dynamics and forecasting. The sensors, built with off-the-shelf components, cost approximately $100 to build. For more information, visit the Fire Sensors website.
          - Co-creator and Instructor (with Dr. Stull) of a new fourth-year Synoptic Fire Weather Forecasting Course, which includes the following topics:
            - Analyze and interpret weather-observation data,
            - Interpret numerical weather prediction models,
            - Apply meteorological principles to fire behavior,
            - Compare alternative fire spread/danger outcomes given weather forecast uncertainty,
            - Develop fire response plan of the day materials (as if they were professional fire-weather forecasters).
          - Each Friday, a graduate or fourth-year undergraduate student in the Atmospheric Science Department is required to do a weekend weather forecast. I am considered the Graduate Student Subject Matter Expert and assist the student in developing their one-hour forecast.
          - Teacher Assistant for Dr. Stull's Weather Instruments Course
          - Assist with developing grant proposals that fund various research projects within the department.

          - Notable Coursework:
            - Data Analysis in Atmospheric, Earth, and Ocean Sciences
            - Boundary-Layer Meteorology
            - Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)

          -	Assisted Dr. Katja Friedrich and Nicholas Luchetti (Ph.D. student) in evaluating thunderstorm outflow boundaries in WRF-Fire. 
          - Tasks included
            - Detecting and analyzing 26 observed outflow boundaries in the Colorado Front Range to validate WRF's ability to accurately model gust fronts.
            - Analyzing the characteristics of each individual outflow boundary using a variety of remote sensing and in-situ instruments. Depth, length, propagation speed/direction, temperature/pressure change, turbulence, and maximum velocity throughout the boundary layer was quantified and categorized depending on the thunderstorm type, terrain, and ambient atmospheric conditions.

          - Collected precipitation samples for the <a target="_blank" href="http://nadp.slh.wisc.edu/">National Atmospheric Deposition Program</a> (NADP).
          - Obtained digital and physical samples from two gauge sites located at an elevation of approximately 11,800 feet.
          - Commuted to each location on a snowmobile or utility terrain vehicle (UTV) to ensure the NADP received data to support their research.
          - Digital and physical samples collected and transmitted to NADP included data from a NOAH IV rain gauge and a non-contaminated weighed precipitation sample.
          - Gauge sites also required routine equipment maintenance, and on occasion, emergency repairs were needed (regardless of weather conditions).

          - Responsible for maintaining a diverse trail network located in arid desert and high alpine locations. 
          - The level of trail repair and maintenance varied in each climatic zone due to variable soil composition and respected rates of erosion. 
          - Dispatched for days at a time in remote areas where the only way to communicate was via satellite phone. 
          - Extended assignments required on-the-spot creative problem solving with limited resources.
          - The work was dangerous and strenuous, requiring the use of various safety measures. 
          - Completed USFS National Fire Response training and was dispatched to fight multiple fires in the 2016 fire season.

          - The Maroon Bells, located approximately 5 miles from Aspen CO, is the most visited scenic area in one of the most visited National Forests in the Nation. 
          - Helped mitigate the damage to the area from overuse by educating the visitors through public contact. 
          - Strong communication skills were required as I often met people from foreign countries with limited or no English language skills.
