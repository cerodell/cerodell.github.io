about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am a Ph.D. Student in Atmospheric Science at the University of British Colombia. Originally from Colorado, I obtained a BA in Physical Geography and a BA in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences from the University of Colorado, Boulder. During that time, I also received a certificate in weather forecasting from Penn State University. My research interests are coupled atmosphere-wildland fire behavior modeling, forest fuel moisture forecasts, wildfire smoke forecasting, and field observations of controlled burns.  A current project of mine is developing a Numerical Weather Prediction derived <a href="https://cerodell.github.io/fwf-docs/build/html/index.html">Fire Weather Forecast Model</a> to assess the moisture content within varied layers of the forest fuels (vegetation). My outside interests include snowboarding, climbing, backpacking, and biking.

          - Assisting Dr. Katja Friedrich and Nicholas Luchetti (Ph.D. student) in evaluating thunderstorm outflow boundaries in WRF-Fire. 
          - My tasks included detecting and analyzing 26 observed outflow boundaries in the Colorado Front Range for the purposes of validating WRF’s ability to accurately model gust fronts.
          - Analyzed the characteristics of each individual outflow boundary using a variety of remote sensing and in-situ instruments. 
          Depth, length, propagation speed/direction, temperature/pressure change, turbulence, and maximum velocity throughout the boundary layer were quantified and categorized depending on the thunderstorm type, terrain, and ambient atmospheric conditions. 
          - For more information: http://clouds.colorado.edu/fire/

          - Collected precipitation samples for the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP).
          - Every Tuesday, regardless of weather conditions, I obtained digital and physical samples from two gauge sites located at an elevation of approximately 11,800 feet. 
          - Commuted to each location on snowmobile or utility terrain vehicle (UTV) to ensure the NADP received data to support their research. 
          - Digital and physical samples collected and transmitted to NADP included data from a NOAH IV rain gauge and a non contaminated weighed precipitation sample. 
          - Gauge sites also required routine equipment maintenance and on occasion emergency repairs were required (regardless of weather conditions).

          - Responsible for maintaining a diverse trail network located in arid desert and high alpine locations. 
          - The level of trail repair and maintenance varied in each climatic zone as a result of variable soil composition and respected rates of erosion. 
          - Dispatched for days at a time in remote areas where the only way to communicate was via satellite phone. 
          - Extended assignments required on the spot creative problem solving with limited resources.
          - The work was dangerous and strenuous requiring the use of varied safety measures. 
          - Completed USFS National Fire Response training and was dispatched to fight multiple fires in 2016 fire season.

          - The Maroon Bells, located approximately 5 miles from Aspen CO, is the most visited scenic area in one of the most visited National Forests in the Nation. 
          - Helped mitigate the damage to the area from overuse by educating the visitors through public contact. 
          - Strong communication skills were required as I often met people from foreign countries with limited or no English language skills.
